## This project is way old and has been archived for my own future nostalgia.
### Check out my *new* Solitaire repo [here](https://github.com/spark-c/solitaire)!

A learning project, trying to recreate Solitaire as an in-line text game. Mostly started as a way to spend downtime while out of the house.

Probably abandoned, may pick it back up later
